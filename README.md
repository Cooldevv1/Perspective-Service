# Perspective Service
A Roblox module that allows a similar experience to CSS perspectives in Roblox.

You can use this module for your games and projects, however credit is optional. You can choose to credit me if you wish, however you are not obligated to do so.

>Feel free to contribute to the source here on GitHub if you want to improve PerspectiveService.
